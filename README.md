# GameLab

A website designated to generate interest in GameLab, a mock school interest group. Entry for New Type Works Hacks. Since GameLab is a game development club, the webpage is designed in such a way that it mimics the mechanism of a simple game - the users can interact with the UI and level up as they explore about GameLab.

An on-going project.
